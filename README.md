# Code-Quiz

## Description 
- This project focused on creating a quiz using javascript
- It allowed me to practice using functions and eventlisteners and how to tie in other functions with others
- I ran into issues and decided to restart my code as I had set up the html and javascript poorly
- I was able to fix my errors and have a well functioning application.
